Overview

This is a Pycharm project for a console-based application I developed for practising German with. The code is written in Python using object-oriented programming.

A Github Action was created to publish a docker image that this application is contained inside at Docker Hub.

The purpose of this project was to improve my skills with object-oriented Python code, have a way to learn German with and learn how to use Github Actions to run this application in a docker container.

Folder and file explanations

These files are the project files for a Python Pycharm project for the application.

How to use

The application can be run by either:
1. Opening up the project in Pycharm, installing required dependecies and running the program.
2. Running the main.py file with Python and required dependecies installed.
3. Using a script such as PyInstaller to make an exe file for the program and then running that file with the source word lists in the appropriate locations.
4. By downloading and running the docker image. Go to https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zorrotab/learn_german to obtain the docker image or fork the repository.
